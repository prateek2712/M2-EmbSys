# Water Level Sensor

# Introduction
* The Water Level Indicator detects and indicates the water level in an overhead tank or any other water container using a simple mechanism.

* The sensing is done with a set of nine probes that are mounted at nine distinct levels on the tank walls (with probe 9 to probe 1 in ascending order of height, and a common probe (i.e. a supply carrying probe) at the bottom of the tank). The "tank full" situation is represented by level 8, whereas the "tank empty" condition is represented by level 0.


# Softwares Used
* Visual Studio
* SimulIDE



## SWOT
### Strengths:
* Easy installation.
* Low maintenance.
* Compact elegant design.
* The Automatic water level controller ensures no    overflows or dry running of pump there by saves electricity and water.
* Avoid seepage of roofs and walls due to overflowing tanks.
* Fully automatic, saves man power.
* Consume very little energy, ideal for continuous operation.
* Automatic water level controller provides you the flexibility to decide for yourself the water levels for operations of pump set.
* Shows clear indication of water levels in the overhead tank..

### Weakness:
* The rust, foul and deteriorate.
 

### Opportunities: 
* The water level Inndicator employs a simple mechanism to
detect and indicate the water level in an over head tank or any
other water container



### Treats: 
* In today's dynamic world, slower progress in innovation is always a threat to the organisation.

Many other similar applications available.

## Who:
Automatic Water level Controller can be used in Hotels, Factories, Homes Apartments, Commercial Complexes, Drainage, etc.

## What:
* A Water Level Indicator is a device that allows us to obtain information about any water reservoir. The usage of a water level indication system can help to decrease water waste in any reserve.


## When:
Automatic water level controller will automatically START the pump set as soon as the water level falls below the predetermined level (usually 1/2 tank) and shall SWITCH OFF the pump set as soon as tank is ful


## Where:
Fuel level indicator in vehicles.
Liquid level indicator in the huge containers in the companies.


## How:
* The seven segment display is set to show the digit 0 when the water level is below the minimum detectable level (MDL), indicating that the tank is empty. When the water level reaches level 1 (but not level 2), the connection between the probes is completed (through the conducting medium â€“ water), and the base voltage of the transistor increases.


* This causes the transistor's base-emitter junction to become forward biassed, switching it from cut-off to conduction mode. As a result, the microcontroller's PIN (B7) is pushed to ground, and the matching digit shown by the seven segment display is 1.



* All of the other levels are detected using a similar approach.
